# kula
The Kula trade was a system of honorary gift exchange. The gifts were exchanged freely, with honor being bestowed on the individual who gave the gift. Kula is a web application that helps neighbors connect and exchange items for free. The point isn't to make a quick buck, but instead share things you no longer need that are collecting dust around the house.
